Composite attribute
-------------------
A composite attribute can be divided into smaller subparts. These subparts represent individual basic attributes with their own meanings.

vs

Simple attribute
----------------
Attributes which are not divisible are simply known as simple or atomic attributes.





Single-valued attributes
------------------------
Attributes having single value for a particular entity are known as single-valued attributes.

vs

Multivalued attributes
----------------------
A multivalued attributes may have lower and upper bounds to constrain the number of values allowed for each individual entity.




Derived attributes
------------------
Attributes which are derived from the real entities are known as derived attributes.

vs

Stored attributes
-----------------
The stored attributes are such attributes which are already stored in the database and from which the value of another attribute is derived is called stored attribute.




Complex attributes
------------------
Attributes that can be represented by grouping composite attributes between (), seperating the components with commas, nad by displaying the multivalued attributes between [] are known as complex attributes.

	ex: {Address_phone({Phone(Area_code,Phone_number)},Address(Street_address{Number,Street,flat_number),City,State,Zp))}
